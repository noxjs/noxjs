# Nox.js

Nox.js helps you defining namespaces, injecting your dependencies (if any), using decorators, emitting events and modularizing your application.

It does't need any third-part library, although you can use any with no problems.

The docs can be found here: [http://noxjs.github.io/noxjs/](http://noxjs.github.io/noxjs/)
